Your name is a bird on my palm.
Your name is ice on my tongue.
Your name is a stone in a swamp.
It is a bullet, and a cramp.
Your name is an invisible moment of my lips,
A kiss in the eyes,
My breath in your hold.
Sometimes— a reasonable advise.
Sometimes— snow, and a scold.
A horse on a cloud,
A ball which I try to catch,
A candle which is blown out,
A painful skin scratch.
It is a light from darkness,
A nap which is deep and clean.
Your name is a holy sparkle,
A game which I need to win.
