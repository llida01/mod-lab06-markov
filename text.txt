Tips of blue flame are dancing about,
Home expanses are being neglected.
It's the first time that I’m singing love,
For the first time refusing to racket.
I was all like a desolate garden,
I was greedy for women and potions.
Now, I don’t want to sing and to dance,
And to squander my life void of caution.
If I only could look at your cast
And your eyes’ golden-hazel vortex,
So that, out of love with the past,
You were able to go to none else.
Your light stature, your airy gait,
If you knew in your stubborn feeling
How a hooligan can venerate,
How a hooligan can be lenient.
I’d pass over iniquity dens,
I’d forever quit writing poems,
If I only touched softly your hand
And your hair of a color to autumn.
I would squire you wherever you'd rove
At our homely or alien stretches.
It's the first time that I’m singing love,
For the first time refusing to racket.
